    <h2><strong>Here are some artists that inspire me</strong></h2>


    
    <h3><strong><em>Lana Del Rey</em></strong></h3>

    <h4>There's something almost cinematic about the way she crafts her music—like stepping into a hazy, 
        sun-drenched dream where nostalgia and melancholy intertwine. Her ability to transport listeners isn't 
        just about the sound; it's the storytelling, the raw emotion, the way she blends vintage aesthetics with 
        modern heartache. "Let the Light In" has that wistful intimacy, like a quiet confession, while "West Coast" is all 
        wild shifts, pulling you between slow-burning romance and electrifying chaos. Her music feels like a faded love 
        letter—timeless yet aching with something unspoken. It lingers, not just in sound, but in the way it makes you 
        remember things you never lived. 
    

   
   
        <h3><strong><em>Ruth Asawa</em></strong></h3>

    <h4>Ruth Asawa's wire sculptures are so magical and intricate, transforming something as simple as wire into floating, 
        delicate forms that dance with light and shadow. There's a quiet poetry in the way they hang—both weightless and grounded, 
        structured yet endlessly fluid. What I love most is how they seem to breathe, shifting with perspective, never quite the 
        same from any angle. It's that perfect balance between precision and movement that makes them so mesmerizing, 
        like three-dimensional drawings suspended in air.</h4>

   
   
        <h3><strong><em>Gaurav Gupta</em></strong></h3>

    <h4>Gaurav Gupta is redefining fashion with his bold, sculptural designs that feel more like wearable art. There's a 
        futuristic drama in his work—sharp lines, fluid curves, and an almost otherworldly elegance. 
        His ability to blend structure with movement makes every piece feel alive, as if it's in constant motion. 
        I love how his creations don't just dress the body; they transform it, turning fabric into something sculptural, 
        surreal, and utterly mesmerizing.</h4>
