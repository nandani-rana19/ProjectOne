        <p>I am an international student from India, currently majoring in Visual Communication with a minor in Marketing 
            at San Francisco State University. Design isn't just something I study—it's 
            something I feel deeply connected to, a passion I can't quite put into words. Whether it's typography, branding, 
            or digital media, I love the way design can tell stories, evoke emotions, and create experiences that resonate with 
            people. I'm always looking for new ways to push my creativity, explore fresh perspectives, and refine my visual 
            storytelling skills. Music is a huge part of my life—so much so that I always have a song playing in the background, 
            no matter where I am. Lana Del Rey isn't just an artist I admire; she's an obsession, an inspiration, almost a 
            religion to me. Her music, her artistry, her way of capturing emotions in lyrics—it all speaks to me on another level. 
            While I don't play any instruments or create music myself, I appreciate every detail, from production to lyrics, 
            and I find so much comfort in it. 
            Outside of design and music, I have a deep love for movement and creativity in other forms. 
            Working out keeps me grounded, cooking is my therapy, and driving is one of my favorite escapes—it's just me, 
            the road, and my thoughts (usually with Lana playing, of course). Being thousands of miles away from home has been 
            a journey in itself—sometimes lonely, sometimes challenging, but also transformative. It's given me space to grow, 
            build confidence, and truly focus on myself. I miss my family and friends deeply, but San Francisco is starting to 
            feel like home in ways I never expected. One of the things I adore most about SF is its mix of tourist hotspots 
            and hidden local gems. I know it might be a cliché, but I genuinely love visiting the Pier, watching the waves crash
            against the shore, and feeling the energy of the city. The beach and coffee are my ultimate comfort duo, and that's 
            why one of my favorite places in the city is Andytown Coffee Roasters on the Great Highway—nothing beats sipping a 
            perfect cup of coffee while taking in the ocean breeze. And of course, I love the rain, which makes the city feel 
            even more magical. Every day here feels like a new adventure, and as I continue learning, designing, and discovering, 
            I hope to create something that truly reflects who I am. Maybe one day, my work will become part of this city I've 
            come to love so much—a lasting piece of its ever-evolving creative landscape.
